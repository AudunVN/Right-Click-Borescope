# Right-Click Borescope

> Drill down into your web pages, find hidden treasure.

This is a simple chrome add-on that lists all the images under your mouse cursor. Simply right-click and hit "Right-Click Borescope." A modal will pop up that lists all the discovered images.

Use this to get around the dirty tricks that stop us from clicking "open image in new tab"

PRs welcome.
