This is a simple chrome/firefox add-on that lists all the images under your mouse cursor. Simply right-click and hit "Right-Click Borescope." A modal will pop up that lists all the discovered images.

Use this to get around the dirty tricks that stop us from clicking "open image in new tab"

PRs welcome.

### Installing

Use the "package.py" script to generate the borescope.chrome.zip and borescope.firefox.zip files. These can then be loaded into your web browser. Or, you can install them from the respective web store/add-on repository. (Firefox pending)
